# Ephemera Web Client
This is the folder to provide the web client for the Ephemera project. All that will be served to the client is located in the `public` folder, all else is for webserver testing as it is not yet known how exactly we will implement that. At the moment, Paul MacLean (ditto2642) is the main person working on this.
