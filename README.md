# Ephemera
A simulation game in which aliens move about the universe and compete for resources, in Java

Ephemera is a turn-by-turn "aliens in space" board game inspired by the University of Washington's "Critters". 
The game board is developed and maintained centrally (currently by guberti and gmein) and students in 
the EPS Programming 2 class develop aliens (Java classes implementing and consuming defined interfaces) as 
their mid-term or final project.

This project will have 6 major parts - 
<ul>
<li> AlienInterfaces - interfaces and common classes between aliens and game</li>
<li> GameEngine - the main engine that queues aliens and runs games</li>
<li> ConsoleShell - minimal command line shell for running the game, mostly for testing</li>
<li> GUIShell - desktop JavaFX UI for the game</li>
<li> WebShell - web version of the game shell</li>
<li> StockAliens - Alien implementations for stocking the game board and as example code for students</li>
</ul>
  
We are currently developing version 1.0. There is a lot of code that can't stay as it is, and we are aware. 
This is a learning project, and so this is to be expected. That said, feel free to point it out to us at any time. 

See the Wiki for details.
